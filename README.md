Mobile app replicating Mercedes Sound Drive system.


How it works:


The app connects to your phone's GPS and tracks your speed

The volume of the phone is related to the car speed

You set the checkpoints where you want the volume to change

There is also an option for playing a song after reaching a certain speed, and stopping it after slowing down
